      <h2>THE RULES!</h2>
      <p>Player attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.</p>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <p>An ace is worth 1 or 11. If the card cound goes over 21 for any of the participants, the ace is automatically worth 1, else, it's worth 11.</p>
      <p>If a participant's hand has 2 or more aces, only one of these may be worth 1.</p>
      <p>Once the player stands, the dealer's face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, dealer must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, or his hand is worth more than player's, at which point the dealer must stand.</p>
      <p>The participant who reaches 0$ first, is the one to lose the match.</p>
